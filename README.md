LedCube Visualisation
=====================
[LedCube Visualisation](https://github.com/vidavidorra/LedCube-Visualisation/) is a Windows program that visualizes a 8x8x8 RGB LED cube and can be used to visualize a LED cube without risking of damaging the actual LED cube. In the future this program can possibly also be used to program the LedCube by visually programming sequences.<br />
